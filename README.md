# NewBot ðŸ¤–
A badly named Discord bot, which I am using as a fun way to get back into JavaScript/Node programming after a long time doing low level.

## Authentication:
- The bot expects a file called auth.json which shall contain a "token" property. This is your Discord Bot API token which will authenticate us with the Discord API.

## Running:
- Just do `yarn start`, this will run the start script and automatically run the bot. Feel free to use this bot in your own servers or fork it under what the MIT license permits.
